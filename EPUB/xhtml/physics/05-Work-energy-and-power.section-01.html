  <body><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We use the idea of work every day.  We talk about going to work, doing homework, working in class. What do we mean and are we correct?</p>

<p>In Physics we mean something very specific when we use the term work. Work is the process
        of transferring energy.</p>

<p>You will learn that work and energy are closely related. You shall see that the 
        energy of an object is its capacity to do work and doing work is the process of transferring 
        energy from one object or form to another. In other
words,</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
            
<p>an object with lots of energy can do lots of work.</p>

          </li>
<li>
            
<p>when work is done, energy is lost by the object doing work and gained by the object on which the work is done.</p>

          </li>
</ul><p>Lifting objects or throwing them requires that you do work on them. Even making an electrical current flow requires that something do work. Something must have energy and transfer it through doing work to make things happen.</p>
