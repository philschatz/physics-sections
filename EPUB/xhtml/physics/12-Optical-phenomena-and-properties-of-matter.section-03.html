<h3>Emission spectra</h3>

<p>You have learnt previously about the structure of an atom. The electrons 
          surrounding the atomic nucleus are arranged in a series of levels of increasing 
          energy. Each element has a unique number of electrons in a unique configuration
           therefore each element has its own distinct set of energy levels. This arrangement 
          of energy levels serves as the atom's unique fingerprint.</p>

<p>In the early 1900s, scientists found that a liquid or solid heated to high 
          temperatures would give off a broad range of colours of light. However, a gas 
          heated to similar temperatures would emit light only at certain specific wavelengths 
          (colours). The reason for this observation was not understood at the time.</p>

<p>Scientists studied this effect using a discharge tube.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="dischargetube"><img src="images/discharge_tube.eps" width="624"/><figcaption class="caption"><p>
              
</p><p>Diagram of a discharge tube. The tube is filled with a gas. When a high 
              enough voltage is applied across the tube, the gas ionises and acts like a 
              conductor, allowing a current to flow through the circuit. The current excites 
              the atoms of the ionised gas. When the atoms fall back to their ground state, 
              they emit photons to carry off the excess energy.</p>

            </figcaption></figure><p>A discharge tube (shown in Figure <a href="#dischargetube" data-class="InternalLink">dischargetube</a>) is a 
          gas-filled, glass tube with a metal plate at both ends. If a large enough voltage difference 
          is applied between the two metal plates, the gas atoms inside the tube will absorb 
          enough energy to make some of their electrons come off, i.e. the gas atoms are ionised. 
          These electrons start moving through the gas and create a current, which raises some 
          electrons in other atoms to higher energy levels. Then as the electrons in the atoms 
          fall back down, they emit electromagnetic radiation (light). The amount of light 
          emitted at different wavelengths, called the <strong>emission 
          spectrum</strong>, is shown for a discharge tube filled with hydrogen gas in 
          <a href="#hydrogenspectrum" data-class="InternalLink">hydrogenspectrum</a> below. Only certain wavelengths (i.e. colours) 
          of light are seen, as shown by the lines in the picture.</p>

            </figcaption></figure><p>Eventually, scientists realised that these lines come from photons of 
          a specific energy, emitted by electrons making transitions between specific 
          energy levels of the atom. Figure <a href="#fig-Henergy" data-class="InternalLink">fig-Henergy</a> shows an example 
          of this happening. When an electron in an atom falls from a higher energy 
          level to a lower energy level, it emits a photon to carry off the extra energy. 
          This photon's energy is equal to the energy difference between the two energy 
          levels

          energy through the equation <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">E=hf</annotation></semantics></math>. Since a specific photon 
          frequency (or wavelength) gives us a specific colour, we can see how each 
          coloured line is associated with a specific transition.</p>

</p><p>In the first diagram are shown some of the electron energy levels for the
              hydrogen atom. The arrows show the electron transitions from higher energy 
              levels to lower energy levels. The energies of the emitted photons are the 
              same as the energy difference between two energy levels. You can think of 
              absorption as the opposite process. The arrows would point upwards and the 
              electrons would jump up to higher levels when they absorb a photon of the 
              right energy. The second representation shows the wavelengths of the light
              that is emitted for the the various transitions. The transistions are 
              grouped into a series based on the lowest level involved in the transition.</p>

            </figcaption></figure><p>Visible light is not the only kind of electromagnetic radiation emitted. More energetic or less energetic transitions can produce ultraviolet or infrared radiation. However, because each atom has its own distinct set of energy levels (its fingerprint!), each atom has its own distinct emission spectrum.</p>
<h3>Absorption spectra</h3>

<p>Atoms do not only emit photons; they also absorb photons. If a photon hits an 
          atom and the energy of the photon is the same as the gap between two electron energy 
          levels in the atom, then the electron in the lower energy level can absorb the photon 
          and jump up to the higher energy level. If the photon energy does not correspond
          to the difference between two energy levels then the photon will not be absorbed (it
          can still be scattered).</p>

<p>Using this effect, if we have a source of photons of various energies we can 
          obtain the <strong>absorption spectra</strong> for different materials. 
          To get an absorption spectrum, just shine white light on a sample of the material that 
          you are interested in. White light is made up of all the different wavelengths of 
          visible light put together. In the absorption spectrum there will be gaps.
          The gaps correspond to energies (wavelengths) for which there is a corresponding
          difference in energy levels for the particular element.</p>

<p>The absorbed photons show up as black lines because the photons of these wavelengths 
          have been absorbed and do not show up. Because of this, the absorption spectrum is 
          the exact <em>inverse</em> of the emission spectrum. 
          Look at the two figures below. In Figure <a href="#fig-emissionSpec" data-class="InternalLink">fig-emissionSpec</a> you can see 
          the line emission spectrum of hydrogen. Figure <a href="#fig-absorptionSpec" data-class="InternalLink">fig-absorptionSpec</a> shows the 
          absorption spectrum. It is the exact opposite of the emission spectrum! Both emission 
          and absorption techniques can be used to get the same information about 
          the energy levels of an atom.</p>

<p>The dark lines, absorption lines, correspond to the frequencies of the emission

<p>This is the same energy as the photons which were absorbed by the gas in the container! Therefore, since the transitions of all elements are unique, we can say that the gas in the container is hydrogen. The transition is absorption of a photon between Energy Level 2 and Energy Level 3.</p>

</div><h3>Applications of emission and absorption spectra</h3>

<p>The study of spectra from stars and galaxies in astronomy is i
          called <em>spectroscopy</em>. Spectroscopy is a 
          tool widely used in astronomy to learn different things about astronomical objects.</p>
<h4>Identifying elements in astronomical objects using their spectra</h4>

<p>Measuring the spectrum of light from a star can tell astronomers what the 
            star is made of. Since each element emits or absorbs light only at particular 
            wavelengths, astronomers can identify what elements are in the stars from 
            the lines in their spectra. From studying the spectra of many stars we know 
            that there are many different types of stars which contain different 
            elements and in different amounts.</p>
<h4>Determining velocities of galaxies using spectroscopy</h4>

<p>You have already learnt in <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://everythingscience.co.za/grade-12/09-doppler-effect/">Chapter 9</a><a href="#chap-doppler-effect" data-class="InternalLink">chap-doppler-effect</a> about the Doppler 
            effect and how the frequency (and wavelength) of sound waves changes 
            depending on whether the object emitting the sound is moving 
            <em>towards</em> or 
            <em>away</em> from you. The same thing happens 
            to electromagnetic radiation (light). If the object emitting the light is 
            moving <em>towards</em> us, then the wavelength 
            of the light appears shorter (called <strong>blueshifted</strong>). 
            If the object is moving <em>away</em> from us, 
            then the wavelength of its light appears stretched out 
            (called <strong>redshifted</strong>).</p>

<p>The Doppler effect affects the spectra of objects in 
            space depending on their motion relative to us on the earth. For 
            example, the light from a distant galaxy that is moving away from us 
            at some velocity will appear redshifted. This means that the emission 
            and absorption lines in the galaxy's spectrum will be shifted to a longer 
            wavelength (lower frequency). Knowing where each line in the spectrum 
            would normally be if the galaxy was not moving and comparing it to 
            the redshifted position, allows astronomers to precisely measure the velocity 
            of the galaxy relative to the Earth.</p>
<h4>Global warming and greenhouse gases</h4>

<p>The sun emits radiation (light) over a range of wavelengths that 
            are mainly in the visible part of the spectrum. Radiation at these 
            wavelengths passes through the gases of the atmosphere to warm the 
            land and the oceans below. The warm earth then radiates this heat 
            at longer infrared wavelengths. Carbon dioxide (one of the main 
            greenhouse gases) in the atmosphere has energy levels that correspond 
            to the infrared wavelengths that allow it to absorb the infrared radiation. 
            It then also emits at infrared wavelengths in all directions. This 
            effect stops a large amount of the infrared radiation from getting out of the 
            atmosphere, which causes the atmosphere and the earth to heat up. More 
            radiation is coming in than is getting back out.</p>

<p>Explain how atomic emission spectra arise and how they relate to each element on the periodic table.</p>

              </div><div class="solution">
                  
<p>Atomic emission spectra arise from electrons dropping from higher energy levels to lower energy levels within the atom, photons (light packets) with specific wavelengths are released. The energy levels in an atom are specific/unique to each element on the periodic table therefore the wavelength of light emitted can be used to determine which element the light came from.</p>

<p>How do the lines on the atomic spectrum relate to electron transitions between energy levels?</p>

              </div><div class="solution">
                  
<p>The lines on the atomic spectrum relate to electron transitions between energy levels, if the electron drops an energy level a photon is released resulting in an emission line and if the electron absorbs a photon and rises an energy level an absorption line is observed on the spectrum.</p>

<p>Explain the difference between atomic absorption and emission spectra.</p>

              </div><div class="solution">
                  
<p>The difference between absorption and emission spectra are that absorption lines are where light has been absorbed by the atom thus you see a dip in the spectrum whereas emission spectra have spikes in the spectra due to atoms releasing photons at those wavelengths.</p>
