  <body><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In this chapter we are going to look at the motion of objects that are either projected, thrown, or shot directly into the air, be it vertically upwards, downwards or when objects are dropped.
          This is something that everyone has experienced while playing games and we all have a strong intuition that "what goes up, must come down", but 
          now we'll study why that is the case.</p>
