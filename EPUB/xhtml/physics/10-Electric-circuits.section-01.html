  <body><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The study of electrical circuits is essential to understanding the technology that 
        uses electricity in the real-world. In this chapter we will focus on revising content 
        from Grade 11 and extending our understanding of the internal structure of a battery/cell 
        and how this influences what you already know about circuits.</p>
